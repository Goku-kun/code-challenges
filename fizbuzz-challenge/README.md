# The Fizzbuzz challenge

"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

This challenge is based on a childrenâ€™s game used to teach division. Children sit in a circle. The player going first will say one, followed by the player next to them (going clockwise or counter-clockwise) saying two, and so on, adding one each time. However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word Fizz, any divisible by five by the word Buzz, and numbers divisible by both three and five become FizzBuzz. A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is eliminated from the game.
